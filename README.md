# BLE-RSSI-indoor-localization

Experiment topology:

Here are available the data sets collected in a 5.9m x 8.3m laboratory, that could be considered as a high noise environment due to the presence of various metal shelves, computers and other different electronics devices. These conditions allowed for signals to experience obstructions and interference.
The devices used for data collection were: 3 Puck.js are transmitter located in Node A, B and C, and one Bangle.js as receiver.
In total, 16 fingerprints were gathered. The points were taken to be 1.3m apart in which was established as x direction (defining the x coordinate), and 0.9m apart in the other direction (for the y coordinate). 


- 2 data sets, composed of RSSI values measured in each of the 16 fingerprints were collected with the bangle pointing in 2 directions. 
    1. Data set 1: the antennas of the beacons and the bangle display were pointed at the front wall.
    2. Data set 2: the antennas of the beacons were pointed at the back wall and the bangle display were pointed at the left wall.
